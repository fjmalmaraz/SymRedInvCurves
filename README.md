# *SymRedInvCurves*:
# Software for continuation of Symmetric Invariant curves for Skew-Product 

This is a software to find 1--parameter families of symmetric invariant curves of a forced 1-D
maps (a.k.a skew-product)  with Lyapunov exponent constant. This software has been used to perform  the numerical continuation for the paper 
*On non-smooth pitchfork bifurcations in invertible quasi-periodically forced 1-D maps* by [A. Jorba](http://www.maia.ub.es/~angel/) (U. Barcelona), [F.J. Munoz-Almaraz](https://www.uchceu.es/directorio/fj-munoz-almaraz) (U. CEU-Cardenal Herrera) and J.C. Tatjer (U. Barcelona) . 

## Software dependencies 

- A C compiler, GCC-4.2 compiler has been used for all the calculations in the paper 

- Fast Fourier Transform West [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/) with a public repository in Github [https://github.com/FFTW/fftw3](https://github.com/FFTW/fftw3).

## Run instructions 

Execute the following commands on a terminal 

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/fjmalmaraz/SymRedInvCurves SymRedInvCurves
$ cd SymRedInvCurves
$ make
$ ./cont_complex.exe
```

## Settings 

The forced 1-D map can be change modifying the file [cont_complex.c](https://github.com/fjmalmaraz/SymRedInvCurves/blob/master/cont_complex.c). Parameters to control continuation method can be modified in [parameter.h](https://github.com/fjmalmaraz/SymRedInvCurves/blob/master/parameter.h). A description is provided in the [documetation](https://github.com/fjmalmaraz/SymRedInvCurves/blob/master/doc/SymRedInvCurves.pdf) (doc folder).
